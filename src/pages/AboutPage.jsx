        Hi, I’m Stephen Lee, a junior fullstack developer with a passion for crafting dynamic web applications. Currently, I’m diving deep into JavaScript and TypeScript, which I find both powerful and versatile for building interactive user interfaces. I’ve really enjoyed working with React; the way it allows me to create engaging experiences keeps me motivated and excited about coding. I love the challenge of transforming ideas into reality through code and am always eager to learn more about the latest tools and technologies in the field.

        On the back end, I’m expanding my knowledge of SQL to effectively manage and manipulate data, ensuring that my applications run smoothly from front to back. I believe that a seamless connection between the two is crucial for delivering a great user experience. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas and learn from others, and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to innovative projects while continuing to grow in this ever-evolving tech landscape.
