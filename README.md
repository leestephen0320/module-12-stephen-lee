## Description
I wanted to create a website that contains the bulk of the work I have worked on during this bootcamp. I wanted to do so using React, the latest of the content of the bootcamp. Through React, I have shown a basic introduction, a selection of my works, a contact form, and a link to my resume.

## Usage
### Header
Top right shows links to the differing pages of the website.

### Footer
Images that open my GitHub, LinkedIn, and AniList profiles in another tab.

### About Me
A brief introduction to myself.

### Portfolio
Six images to previous GitHub projects worked on. Each has a clickable GitHub logo that will open the repository associated with the project in another window.

A form submission. Does not actually submit anything. Upon successful submit, fields will clear. Form will fail to submit and error messages will appear if:
- Name field is empty

A brief resume. Includes a clickable link that downloads a .txt version of the resume.
